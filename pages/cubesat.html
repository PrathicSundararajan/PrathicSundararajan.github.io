    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p id="largeText">This was a program that was introduced to my high school during my sophomore year. After
        getting through an interview process, a team of 10 others and I were selected from my school. We got the
        opportunity to work on the power related components of a CubeSat, a nanosatellite that was 10 cm long on
        each face. The plan was to put this CubeSat together and launch it as a payload on a larger rocket. There
        were a few schools involved in this project from my school district and each school had a different role. We
        had three main mentors throughout the production of these three CubeSats. Ibeth Jaime, the Computer Science
        teacher at our high school, served as our team lead alongside Commander Ronnie Nader from the Ecuadorian
        Space Agency who provided the technical expertise that we lacked in the early stages of our project.
        Finally, Brent Freeze served as the lead for the whole project and was the liaison between the various
        different teams (schools) working on this project. </p>
    <h2> The Projects </h2>
    <h3> Irvine01 </h3>
    <p id="largeText"> This was the first CubeSat that we worked on and as a result the objective was mainly to get
        an introduction into this industry. Our payload was an Omnivision OV3642 Camera with which we planned on
        transmitting information from. However, our primary objective with this educational CubeSat was to learn the
        process of putting one of these CubeSats together. My team was in charge of testing the solar panels, the
        battery, ensuring that the spacecraft’s power budget remained positive and several other tasks related to
        the power of the spacecraft. Since I was a relatively less experienced member on the team as a sophomore, my
        main role was to ensure that the power budget of the CubeSat was operational. This meant that I had to
        contact the various teams to check how much power their components would draw and for how much of the orbit
        cycle their component would actually be on and drawing power. This was rather tedious because I was often
        only given ranges or estimates since certain things were not set in stone yet. However, an important lesson
        I learned through this is to always consider the worst case possible in all scenarios just to be on the
        cautious side as emphasized by our mentor Cdr. Nader. The original plan was to launch this CubeSat into
        space in early 2018 and this would have made us the first high school team to have successfully launched a
        CubeSat into space. However due to significant delays, we were unable to launch it into space until November
        11th, 2018 on the “It’s Business Time” Rocket by Rocket Lab in New Zealand. Post launch, we were able to
        locate and communicate with this CubeSat using the radio station at Cal Poly SLO. We received telemetry data
        which consisted of the CubeSat’s position as well as temperature and voltage data from different components.
        In addition, we also received a picture from the camera on the CubeSat which can be seen below. </p>

    <h3> Irvine02 </h3>
    <p id="largeText"> By the time we started this project, I had learned a lot more about this area of work and
        thus took on more responsibility. In addition, many of the seniors had left and this left a few veterans,
        but most of the members of the team were new members who did not have any previous experience with the work
        we were doing. A lot of the logistics for this second CubeSat was very similar to the first one we had
        worked on. Like before, we were carrying an Omnivision OV3642 Camera as our payload. This time we were also
        using an EXA FEROX Class 450/15 Pulsed Laser to hopefully speed up the communication. In addition, we
        planned on applying for an ELaNa (Educational Launch of Nanosatellites) Launch funded by NASA. In order to
        do this, we would need to attend a design review in which we got feedback from industry professional about
        our proposal. So, once we put together a proposal which basically explained the different aspects of our
        mission and the work all our teams would be doing, we attended this Design Review held by experts from JPL
        and NASA. For this design review, I served in a runner up capacity for the presenters of our team. Once we
        had received the RFAs (requests for action) on our proposal, we made the necessary changes, submitted our
        ELaNa application and proceeded to complete the required testing. Later on, in the year, we were notified
        that we were accepted into the ELaNa Launch program and given certain deadlines to meet. Unfortunately, due
        to a lack of proper documentation, we did not have the procedures and experiments we ran on the first
        CubeSat so we had to start basically from scratch with what we knew and with the help of our mentor Cdr.
        Nader. This time around, I was in charge of not only the power budget but also served as the DSA team lead.
        This meant that my sub-team and I would be responsible for all aspects of the DSAs such as ensuring that the
        solar cells successfully charged the battery, that the panels would release and deploy within the allotted
        time, etc. I did not want to repeat the mistakes of the past so this time around, I ensured that we wrote
        testing protocols and documented the experiments that we did run so that they could be referenced in the
        future. This was much more tedious because it meant that it would slow us down, but my team and I through
        our past mistakes recognized the importance of this and ensured to do so. Since we had previously done this
        testing, it was not difficult to carry out and Irvine02 was flight ready by the time my class graduated. It
        launched 1 month after Irvine01 on the Falcon 9 (as a part of ELaNa 24) and we became the first high school team
        to
        launch two CubeSats in one year. Post launch, we were unsuccessful in communicating with Irvine02. We were
        unable to diagnose the most likely cause of this and the current team is still attempting to reach a
        conclusion. </p>

    <h3> Irvine03 </h3>
    <p id="largeText"> For Irvine03, my team and I mostly worked on creating the plans and proposals for what we
        wished to do with this CubeSat. Due to a restrictive timeline, we were
        forced to do it alongside the testing we conducted for Irvine02. Irvine03’s
        payload was a science module which is connected to the Cubesat's Camera and
        GPS module. It is also utilizing a new electrospray thruster and an X-ray
        Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) sensor. My main focus during this stage for Irvine03 was
        perfecting the power budget and ensuring that using our payload intermittently would not render the power budget
        negative. Like Irvine02, we
        were planning to apply for the ELaNa Launch so we needed to complete our proposal before our scheduled
        design review that way we could receive the necessary feedback and then apply for the Launch within the
        deadline. This time, I was in charge of presenting the power budget and shields on the CubeSat during the
        design review to the judges from. Like we had done in the past, we received the RFAs and proceeded to
        improve our proposal before we submitted our application for the ELaNa launch. It was around this point in
        which my class graduated high school so we left the actual hardware testing for Irvine03 up to the veteran
        members of the CubeSat team who would not be graduating.</p>

    <h2> Longterm Outcome </h2>
    <p id="largeText">This program was one of the earliest things that exposed me to industry level work. We got to
        work with top of the line individuals in their respective fields while getting the chance to build these
        CubeSats with top notch equipment supplied by industry leaders. I learnt a lot in terms of how long-term
        projects such as this one are done at an industry level. This was further emphasized because of how large of
        an effort this was among so many different individuals across the different schools. In addition, I really
        improved my leadership skills while attempting to unite my team with this project especially during a time
        in which many of them were struggling with school work and other academic struggles high school students
        endure such as AP classes, SATs and college applications. Overall this opportunity was a great one because I
        got the chance to work on such a cool project with a great group of individuals with whom I have made great
        friendships with. </p>
