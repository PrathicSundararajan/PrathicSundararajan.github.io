    <h2> Independent Tutor (2018) </h2>
    <p id="largeText">
        During my senior year and summer after, I tutored neighborhood kids ranging from 6th Grade to Freshman in High
        School for Math & Spanish. </p>
    <h2> Irvine Unified School District Tutor (2016-2018) </h2>
    <p id="largeText">
        I initially was a permanent tutor for a pre-algebra class at my highschool. I mainly helped the teacher and
        students in anyway possible to help facilitate their education. After that year of staying in the classroom and
        helping the kids in that classroom, I moved onto tutoring at the tutor center. This was a drop-in form of
        tutoring held after school everyday (except Friday). At this position, I tutored for Math: Pre-Algebra through
        Calc BC / Science: AP Bio, AP Physics, Lower Level Science / Computer Science: AP Computer Science (JAVA). I
        tutored at the tutor center during my Junior & Senior year. As a part of becoming a tutor at my school district
        (Irvine Unified School District), I had to complete a mandated tutoring program to learn how to tutor properly.

        </a> leads you to a folder with all my required submissions to pass the program and become a certified tutor.

    <h2> Secretary and Founding Board Member of Road to Success (2016-2018) </h2>
    <p id="largeText">
        Due to the success of the tutor center, our advisor recommended that we start a club in which we held mandatory
        meetings for all tutors to attend. We essentially held lectures and taught methods to improve the effectiveness
        of the tutors we had on campus. We found that this generally made the Tutor Center better as a whole. My role in
        this club was as a secretary. </p>
    <h2> Tustin Unified School District Math Tutor (2015) </h2>
    <p id="largeText">
        I along with a several of my peers from high school helped out TUSD when they needed volunteers to help tutor 6th
        graders because of a lack of funds. We meet with 6th grade classes twice a week and just helped them with
        their math homework and answered any questions they might have. </p>
