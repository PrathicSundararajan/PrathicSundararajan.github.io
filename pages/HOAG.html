            I served at the HOAG hospital located in Irvine. My main position
            was at the front desk located at the main entrance. I usually helped
            a staff member who would already be stationed there with any tasks
            that they needed help with. In addition, at times I would be alone
            at the desk and would be the first person anyone would meet if they
            used the main entrance to the hospital. My duties at this position
            ranged from prepping the required forms new visitors would have to
            sign to directing individuals either to the specific doctor they
            wished to visit or to escort them to the emergency room.
