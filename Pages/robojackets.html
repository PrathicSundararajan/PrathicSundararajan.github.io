    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p id="largeText">This project was based around Motorama, a
        competition which is held annually. We planned to participate in the
        3lb BattleBot division. The competition essentially entailed an
        elimination style tournament in which each team would control their
        3lb BattleBot, essentially it was just a remote-controlled car that
        had a weapon and shielding, in hopes of disabling their enemy bot
        first for the win. After this competition, we were also able to
        compete in RoboGames, a similar competition held by Georgia Tech.

        machined. </p>
    <h2> The Project </h2>
    <h3> Designing </h3>
    <p id="largeText"> This competition had really only 1 main
        rule, keep whatever you build under 3lbs. My team and I
        initially began with a design phase of our bot. We then advanced
        to model the bot in SolidWorks. We were able to use some
        standard parts such as the DYS 20A Micro Opto Multi-Rotor ESCs,
        screws and wheels. In terms of electronics, we used a 1000mAH
        lithium polymer battery. Refer to our wiki for further specific
        information regarding parts as well as the motors used. But most
        of the other parts were items we created from scratch based on
        our initial design. We chose to use a beater bar for our weapon
        made out of Steel that connected to Aluminum hubs and
        Stainless-Steel roller ball bearings. We had an axle going
        through the weapon on each side of the bot on the inside of the
        beater bar to increase the structural integrity of the weapon.
        Rather than using a conventional surface for the back of the bot
        we decided to use a High-Density Polyethylene sheet which we
        could bend around the top and bottom plate. We found that this
        would decrease the rigidity of the bot as well as provide more
        space for the electronics. <br> Next, we participated in our
        first Design Review in which several mentors of the project gave
        us useful comments. They mentioned that the axle in its current
        state would a be a risk to the bot since it would be difficult
        to have it both be connected to the sidewalls as well as the
        weapon. In addition, they let us know that we needed to add
        skids to the bottom of our side plates to prevent the weapon
        from ever hitting the ground as this would lead to the bot
        sustaining serious damage due to the high speeds of rotation the
        weapon would be operating at. They also highly recommended that
        we increase the width of the weapon to increase the amount of
        damage it could deal. Once we made these recommended
        modifications, we found that our total weight will be exceeded 3
        lbs so we made a parabolic cut on both the top and bottom plate
        so the side closest to the weapon was in the shape of a
        parabola. This reduction was enough for us to meet our
        requirement. After these changes, we participated in a final
        design review in which all our changes were approved, and our
        bot was deemed ready for production.</p>

    <h3> Production for Motorama 2019 </h3>
    <p id="largeText"> We essentially created the bot from scratch
        materials such as sheet metals for the walls of the bot, a
        sheet HDPE for the back, a steel block for the weapon and steel
        cylinders. We ordered the wheels, bearings and electronics
        mostly from McMaster. With the help of our mentors, we got
        access to CNC Milling Equipment through the program at Georgia
        Tech. In addition, they trained us in using Bandsaws, Lathes
        and Mills. The only aspect which we were not able to directly
        do by ourselves was the water jetting that was required for the
        weapon and sidewalls. This was done by a mentor due to certain
        regulations on campus. One of the first things we worked on in
        terms of production was milling the required screw holes in the
        side walls as well as the holes required for the hubs holding
        our weapon to be attached to. We had the chance to use
        programmable and also manual mills. Once these screws holes
        were made, depending on if they were clearance or through
        holes, we tapped them so that we could have threads on them.
        Next, we worked on lathing the hubs to the right sizes. While
        working on this, we had two members working on the electronics
        of the bot. There were certain modifications we had to do on
        the items we had bought from the supplier to meet the required
        specifications for our product. Once this was all done, we
        realized that we were still slightly overweight, so we cut out
        triangles in our side and top walls to meet the weight
        requirement. Our record at competition was 1 – 2 overall. </p>
    <h3> Production for Robogames </h3>
    <p id="largeText"> Before our next competition, we had the
        chance to make some changes and redo certain parts that were
        badly damaged. We decided to make the depth of the hubs longer
        since that was one the weakest parts on our robot. Rather than
        doing it later, we had the triangles cut out initially so that
        we would not have to worry about doing this manually before
        competition. The final issue was our belt for the weapon motor.
        We had destroyed our previous one during the last competition
        and we didn’t have a spare of the same size so we needed to
        figure out a way to make a larger belt work. We did this by
        using a hub without a grove for it to set on. We had to add a
        screw to the hub to ensure that the belt wouldn’t just walk off
        while being used.</p>

    <h2> Results </h2>
    <p id="largeText">For the first competition, out of three games we
        won one and lost two games. The main issues with our bot had to do
        with our drive motors and the hubs to maintain the weapon. For the
        second competition, we advanced to semifinals from pool play with a
        similar record. However, our bot broke apart when the enemy bot
        hooked the side plate and ripped the weapon out of the hubs. Refer
        to the linked wiki for further details into how we performed at
        competition as well as our analysis on the strengths and weaknesses
        of our bot. </p>

        <h2> Longterm Outcome </h2>
        <p id="largeText"> Until this project, I had previous hands on
            experience with parts such as solar panels and batteries from the
            CubeSats I worked on earlier. However, this experience was in a very
            limited area. I did not have the chance to really start from scratch
            and build a product such as this one. I got exposure to CAD in the
            form of SolidWorks and this was very useful as I will need this for
            industry as well as for my future class. Another useful set of
            skills I learned that most engineers should know is CNC Milling.
            This project served as a very cool introduction into the equipment
            available at Tech for us to use. Finally, this was a great project
            for me to do coming from having done CubeSat because it took the
            skills I learned in that project to a whole another level. For
            example, I had previously attended formal design reviews for the
            CubeSat we planned on launching with experts from NASA and JPL in
            attendance but my role on that project was solely regarding power
            related components. However, I gained a lot more exposure to that
            aspect of industry through this project.</p>
