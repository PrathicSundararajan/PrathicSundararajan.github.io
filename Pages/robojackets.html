        <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p id="largeText" >This project was based around Motorama, a competition which is held annually. We planned to participate in the 3lb Battlebot division. The competition essentially entailed an elimination style tournament in which each team would control their 3lb battlebot, essentially it was just a remote controlled car that had a weapon and shielding, in hopes of disabling their enemy bot first for the win. After this competition, we were also able to compete in Robogames, a similar competition held by Georgia Tech.</p>
        <h2> The Project </h2>
            <h3> Designing </h3>
                <p id="largeText" > This competition had really only 1 main rule, keep whatever you build under 3lbs. My team and I initially began with a design phase of our bot. We then advanced to model the bot in SolidWorks. We were able to use some standard parts such as the ESCs [CONFIRM], screws and wheels. In terms of electronics, we used a [INSERT] lithium ion battery. But most of the other parts were items we created from scratch based on our initial design. We chose to use a beater bar for our weapon made out of [INSERT] that connected to [INSERT] hubs and [INSERT] roller ball bearings. We had a axle going through the weapon on each side of the bot on the inside of the beater bar to increase the structural integrity of the weapon.  Rather than using a conventional surface for the back of the bot we decided to use a [INSERT] sheet which we could bend around the top and bottom plate. We found that this would decrease the rigidity of the bot as well as provide more space for the electronics. Next, we participated in our first Design Review in which severals mentors of the project gave us useful comments. They mentioned that the axle in its current state would a be a risk to the bot since it would be difficult to have it both be connected to the sidewalls as well as the weapon. In addition, they let us know that we needed to add skids to the bottoms of our side plate to prevent the weapon from ever hitting the ground as this would lead to the bot sustaining serious damage due to the high speeds of rotation [INSERT] the weapon would be operating at. They also highly recommended that we increase the width of the weapon to increase the amount of damage it would do by reducing the hole on the inside of the weapon. Once we made these recommended modifications, we found that our total weight well exceeded 3 lbs so we  made a parabolic cut on both the top and bottom plate so the ending closest to the weapon was in the shape of a parabola. This reduction was enough for us to meet our requirement. After these changes, we participated in a final design review in which all our changes were approved and our bot was deemed ready for production.</p>

            <h3> Production: Compeition 1 </h3>
                 <p id="largeText" > TWe essentially created the bot from scratch materials such as sheet metals for the walls of the bot, a sheet of [INSERT] HDPVE? for the back, steel [CONFIRM] block for the weapon and steel cylinders. We ordered the wheels, bearings and electronics mostly from McMaster. With the help of our mentors, we got access to CNC Milling Equipment through the program at Georgia Tech. In addition, they trained us in using Bandsaws, Lathes and Mills. The only aspect which we were not able to directly do by ourselves was the laser jetting that was required for the weapon and sidewalls. This was done a mentor due to certain regulations on campus. One of the first things we worked on in terms of production was milling the required screw holes in the side walls as well as the holes required for the hubs holding our weapon to be attached to. We had the chance to use programmable and also manual mills. Once these screws holes were made, depending on if they were clearance or through holes [CONFIRM] we tapped them so that we could have threads on them. Next we worked on lathing [CONFIRM] the hubs to the right sizes. While working on this, we had two members working on the electronics of the bot. There were certain modifications we had to do on the items we had bought from the supplier to meet the required specifications for our product. Once this was all done, we realized that we were still slightly overweight so we cut out triangles in our side and top walls to meet the weight requirement. For how we performed refer to the next section. [INSERT (can I add some html scrolls down?)] </p>

            <h3> Production: Compeition 2 </h3>
                 <p id="largeText" > Before our next competition, we had the chance to make some changes and redo certain parts that were badly damaged. We decided to make the depth of the hubs longer since that was one the weakest parts on our robot. Rather than doing it later, we had the triangles cut out initially so that we would not have to worry about doing this manually before competition. The final issue was our belt for the weapon motor. We had destroyed our previous one during the last competition and we didn’t have a spare of the same size so we needed to figure out a way to make a larger belt work. We did this by using a hub without a grove for it to set on. We had to add a screw to the hub to ensure that the belt wouldn’t just walk off while being used.</p>

        <h2> Results </h2>
            <p id="largeText">For the first competition, out of three games we won one and lost two games. The main issues with our bot was [INSERT]. For the second competition, we advanced to semifinals from pool play. However, due to the inability of our</p>
        <h2> Longterm Outcome </h2>
            <p id="largeText"> Until this project, I had previous hands on experience with parts such as solar panels and batteries from the CubeSats I worked on earlier however, it was in a very limited area. I did not have the chance to really start from scratch and build a product such as this one. I got exposure to CAD in the form of SolidWorks and this was very useful as I will need this for industry as well as for my future class. I still have much to learn and plan on learning a lot more. Since this was a team based project, I did not necessarily do a lot for the project from this aspect due to a lack of prior knowledge with Solidworks. Another useful set of skills I learned that most engineers should know is CNC Milling. This project served as a very cool introduction into the equipment available at Tech for us to use. Finally, overall this was a great project for me to do coming from having done CubeSat because it took the skills I learned in that project to a whole another level. For example, I had previously attended formal design reviews for the CubeSat we planned on launching with experts from NASA and JPL in attendance but my role on that project was solely power related components so I did not have much exposure. However, I gained a lot more exposure to that aspect of industry through this project. </p>
