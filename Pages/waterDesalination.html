    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p id="largeText">This was a science project that I worked on during my sophomore year in high school. It was during
        this time period that the drought in California was reaching new lengths and thus I wanted to dedicate some time
        into researching it and the underlying solutions. </p>
    <h2> My Research </h2>
    <p id="largeText"> My investigative question for this project was “How efficient is Reverse Osmosis compared to
        Thermal Distillation?”. I focused mostly on the researching aspect of this project rather than attempting to
        answer my question by conducting a hands-on experiment simply because this was the more feasible method. I used
        public data for the cost of the process of reverse osmosis and thermal distillation. I tried two experiments,
        one for each of the processes of water desalination. However, my experiments were not the best designed
        experiments since I did not have the necessary expensive equipment required to actually simulate these
        processes. My experiments essentially consisted of a model that mimicked how the process would run but due to a
        lack of the needed equipment, the models had several inconsistencies in that they were meant to represent. I did
        find that although my experiments may have been flawed, they agreed with the theoretical numbers I had arrived
        at with the research I had conducted. I found that in the short run, thermal distillation is more cost
        effective. However in the long run, reverse osmosis is one of the better alternatives to switch to especially
        since the technology and science behind the process is constantly being improved as research into these
        membranes and filters advances in industry. I presented my work at the Irvine Unified School District Science
        and advanced to the next level of competition. At the Orange County Science fair, I proceeded to get Honorable
    Mentions and also a Gold Award from the Orange County Water District (w/ a
    $500 award) for my research.</p>

    <h2> Longterm Outcome </h2>
    <p id="largeText"> This project was merely out of self interest in this topic as it was the center of a problem that
        I encountered on a day to day basis. I learned a lot about the state of water desalination through this project
        and was surprised when I learned a new reverse osmosis plant, Claude “Bud” Lewis Carlsbad Desalination Plant,
        was being set up in San but suffered from rather high operational costs and sporadic delays. Overall, this
        project sated my curiosity on this topic and I look forward to seeing how efficient we can truly make the
        reverse osmosis process as our technological advancements progress. </p>
