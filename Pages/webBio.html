    <h1> About this Website </h1>
<p id="largeText"> I made this website to serve as my personal website/portofilo. From the
beginning I knew that it would be difficult to match the styling cabilities on one
of these drag and drop websites like Wix. However, I also did want to make this
project using HTML and CSS. I had previous programing experience but I hadn't
made anything with these two languages so I figured this would be a good chance
to capitalize on that. After the creation of this website, I am contemplating
switching to Angular 4 because of the greater number of options it would offer
in terms of the features I can implement. </p>
